# Anime-Cartoon-Human Face Detector 

A multi-class face image classifier that predicts whether an input image contains an **anime**, **cartoon**, or **real human** face using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Dataset

This project uses custom-sampled data from Kaggle sources:

- **Anime Faces** â€“ from [`splcher/animefacedataset`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/splcher/animefacedataset)
- **Cartoon Faces** â€“ from [`alhumayri/cartoon-classifier`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alhumayri/cartoon-classifier)
- **Human Faces** â€“ from [`ashwingupta3012/real-human-faces`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashwingupta3012/real-human-faces)

To avoid large downloads, each category is limited to 300 samples using `kagglehub`.

-  Dataset sampled and preprocessed from Kaggle via script
-  Organized into `dataset/` subfolders (`anime/`, `cartoon/`, `human/`)
-  Supports training, evaluation, and prediction
-  Visualizations for performance (accuracy, confusion matrix)
